# Lockboxes

This project contains a Python script implementing a function to determine if all lockboxes can be opened.

## Files

* `0-lockboxes.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the `canUnlockAll` function.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Task Description

You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and may contain keys to other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    pass
